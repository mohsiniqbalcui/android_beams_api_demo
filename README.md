# Android Beams client API Demo

Demonstration of the Pusher Beams client SDK for Android

This is a supplemental project for the article [Pusher Beams client API demo for Android](TODO).

## Setup

To test out this demo, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new Android Kotlin app using AndroidX and call the package `com.example.beamsapidemo`.
2. Follow the [Getting Started](https://pusher.com/docs/beams/getting-started/android/configure-fcm) documentation on Pusher Beams to add basic beams support to your app.
3. Replace key files in your app with files from this repo (`MainActivity`, `AndroidManifest`, and so on)
4. Be sure to use your own Beams instance ID

Alternatively, you could clone this project and then replace the Beams instance ID and `google-services.json` file with your own.
